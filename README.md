perm-comparator
===============

Quickly compare effective permissions between users, profiles, and permission sets.  Built on Heroku and Force.com using OAuth2, ExtJS4, and Java with the Play! framework.  The main goal of the app is to help SFDC admins determine what permission differences exist between users, permission sets, and profiles.

App is live here: https://perm-comparator.herokuapp.com
1)  Login to your Salesforce account using OAuth2
2)  When requested, authorize app to access your SFDC data
3)  Drag a User, Permission Set, or Profile to one of the empty columns
4)  Repeat for addition users, permission sets, or profiles
5)  Navigate the common, unique, and differing perms in the middle panel

If you would like to fork or host your own instance of the app, feel free to clone the repo and set up a local server or deploy to your own Heroku account.
